Dependency Ready is a JavaScript class with the sole purpose of waiting for properties to be defined on the standardized [global object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Global_object), [`globalThis`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/globalThis), in order to fire a callback function that relies on the global objects property.
